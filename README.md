PII Detection and Masking with Transformers
This project demonstrates how to detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text using Hugging Face Transformers and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA). The goal is to replace sensitive information (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers) with special tokens (e.g., <NAME>, <EMAIL>, <PHONE>) to ensure privacy compliance.
